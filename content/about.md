## Test


Most users are familiar with purchasing crypto through a **centralized exchange (CEX)** like Coinbase or Binance. CEXes allow you to buy crypto with a debit card and off-ramp back to fiat (cash) when needed.

To interact with **DeFi**, however, you’ll need a **non-custodial wallet**. Unlike a CEX account, a non-custodial wallet gives _you_ full control of your funds and lets you connect directly to dApps (decentralized apps). Currently, wallets allow you to buy crypto with a bank account, however, they lack offramp capabilities (converting crypto back to cash).
