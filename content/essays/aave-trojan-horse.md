@aave has grown to become DeFi's Trojan Horse, reaching a scale comparable to traditional banks. With $35 billion in TVL and $57 billion in net deposits, it now controls 25% of DeFi TVL and ranks among the 50 largest US banks by assets under management (AUM).

This is a reminder that onchain credit markets are no longer niche. Aave is increasingly operating as systemically important infrastructure, and its scale demands the same rigor we apply to traditional financial rails.
